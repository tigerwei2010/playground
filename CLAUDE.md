# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple static web project containing educational content about Claude Code. The repository contains:

- A basic HTML webpage (`claude_code/claude_code.html`) that serves as an introduction to Claude Code
- Minimal documentation in the README

## Architecture

The project has a simple structure:
- `claude_code/claude_code.html` - A standalone HTML file with embedded CSS styling that provides information about Claude Code, including setup instructions, usage examples, and supported programming languages
- No build system, dependencies, or server-side components

## Development

Since this is a static HTML project:
- No build commands are required
- No test framework is set up
- No package management (no package.json or dependencies)
- To view the HTML file, open it directly in a web browser or serve it with a simple HTTP server

The HTML file is self-contained with embedded styles and uses external CDN resources for programming language icons.
